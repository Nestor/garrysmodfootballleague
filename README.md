# garrysmodfootballleague (gfl)
GFL is an attempt to make a half decent football gamemode in Garry's Mod. I was just going to make it so it's not impossible to kick a ball in [this gamemode](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=483685661), then I decided to make my own instead.

I'm planning to add a Stadium Designer currently the in-game stadiums are:
* Training ground (done)
* Sincil Bank (WIP)
