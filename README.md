# garrysmodfootballleague (gfl)
GFL is an attempt to make a half decent football gamemode in Garry's Mod. Due to the fact it's Garry's Mod and this is a side project don't expect a quality product.

To be honest, I'm more bothered about getting crowd-sounds and effects right.

I'm planning to add a Stadium Designer currently the in-game stadiums are:
* Training ground (done)
* Sincil Bank (WIP)
